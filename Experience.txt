My first month at IITP, if I have to summarize it in one word, I would say 'wierd'. I came here on the 4th of August and like every other student I also had many expectation n assumptions regarding the campus n the facilities here. In many ways I was more than overwhelmed but at times I felt dissapointed. I felt a bit bad in the first week here but as the layers unfolded it became a roller coaster ride, full of fun, excitement and speed. Ours fresher's event prep started n I actually discovered my performing side for the first time when I participated in mime. I even participated in the oratory n the literary clubs here and got to learn a lot from the people there, specially the seniors. Lectures got more n more occupying n we started to manage all the activities simultaneously, making me feel as everything went so fast. It now seems as if it's been really long we have been here though the calendar says it's just been a month.
